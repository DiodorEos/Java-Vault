💡 Project Ideas

🟢 Beginner-Level Projects

1️⃣ Rock-Paper-Scissors!

🔹 Description: A simple game where the player competes against the computer in a classic rock-paper-scissors match. The computer should randomly select one of the three options, and the game should determine the winner.
🔹 Bonus: Expand the game by adding more weapons (e.g., Lizard & Spock from "The Big Bang Theory") and a rule display to explain how different choices interact.

2️⃣ Student Grading System

🔹 Description: A program that takes a numerical input (0-100) and outputs the corresponding letter grade (F to A).
🔹 Bonus: Implement a system that assigns plus and minus grades (e.g., A+, B-, etc.), ensuring a more nuanced grading scale.

🟡 Intermediate-Level Projects

3️⃣ Expense Tracker App

🔹 Description: A command-line-based expense tracking tool that allows users to log expenses, categorize them, and view spending summaries.
🔹 Bonus: Add an alert system that notifies the user when their remaining balance is low or when they exceed their budget for a specific category. Consider implementing CSV or JSON storage for data persistence.

4️⃣ Library Management System

🔹 Description: A simple system for managing books in a library. Users should be able to add, delete, and search for books by title or author. Keep track of available copies.
🔹 Bonus: Make the system more modular so that it can be repurposed for managing other services, such as a movie rental system or digital archive.

🔴 Advanced-Level Projects

5️⃣ SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) System

🔹 Description: A foundational tool for cybersecurity professionals, this project will simulate a SIEM system that aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes security logs. Users can feed in log files, and the system should be able to detect suspicious activity based on predefined rules.
🔹 Key Features: Implement basic log parsing, alerting mechanisms, and a real-time dashboard to display security events. Consider integrating basic anomaly detection algorithms.
🔹 Bonus: Allow users to customize detection rules and filter logs based on severity levels.

6️⃣ Modular Codex Wiki for Game Lore

🔹 Description: A dynamic, interactive wiki designed for storing and organizing game lore. Users should be able to create, categorize, and edit lore entries with a user-friendly interface.
🔹 Key Features: Implement search functionality, tagging, and categorization for easy navigation. Consider a markdown-based system for writing lore entries.
🔹 Bonus: Add version control for changes, allowing users to track edits and revert to previous versions of lore entries. Implement a "related articles" system that suggests connected lore entries based on keywords.
