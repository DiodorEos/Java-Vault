# :coffee: Java Vault - my Full Java Mastering Journey

:wave: Welcome to Java Vault - my personal Java repository for mastering Java, from ground up! This repository will serve as a 🖥️ **learning hub** where I document exercises, projects and code snippets.

## 🗒️ About the repo
In essence, this is my **mastering Java journey** through 📖 *Introduction to Java* by Yiorgos Lakeas, an 830+ A4 book, which covers everything from the basics (methods, classes and collections) up to advanced concepts like real-world database apps, multithreading, synchronization, and networking and communication. <br />
💡 *Objective*: I aim for each commit to be a 📝 solved exercise from the book, a step towards mastering Java!

## 🎯 Goals:
☑️ Reinforce my Java skills with hands-on code<br />
☑️ Showcase my consistency, persistence and problem-solving <br />
☑️ Document solutions for others wishing to learn Java<br />
☑️ Familiarize myself with github<br />

## 📔 Progress & Notes
🚀 I will be updating this repository regularly as I go through my 📖 *Introduction to Java* refresher book and complete various 📝 exercises and 🏆 challenges. <br />
👉 Follow along as I solve each exercise, from the simplest to the most complex ones!
