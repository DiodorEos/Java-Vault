# 🔖 CHAPTER 3 - Program Flow Control #

## 👁️‍🗨️ Overview ##
The third chapter covers clauses and ways to control the program flow:
<br />
<br />
☑️ If clauses <br />
☑️ Switch <br />
☑️ Loops <br />
☑️ Defensive programming <br />
☑️ Continue, Yield, Break <br />

## 🏋️‍♂️ Exercises ##
In this chapter we will find a wide range of exercises: theory questions, defnitions, multiple choice questions, practical exercises and two lab exercises.
<br />
### 🗒️ Theory Questions ###
Here are the theory questions that I chose for this section:
<br />
<details>
  <summary>
    ❓: No. 18 & No. 19: What are three loops in Java and when do we use them? <br />    
  </summary>
  📇: (1) The **for** loop can be used when we know how many repetitions we need. (2) The **while** loop can be used when we do not know how many repetitions we want our loop to go through, but they are dependent on a specific clause. (3) The **do while** loop which is essentially the same as the while loop, but with the key difference that this loop will run at least once.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
   ❓: No. 22: What is the difference between a **while** and a **do while** loop? <br /> 
  </summary>
  📇: While these two can look similar, they have a key difference. The **while** loop will repeat as long as the condition is true. Whereas in the **do while**, the loop will be executed at least once. The condition will be checked at the end.
</details>


### 🖥️ Practical Exercises ###
🔷 **No. 04**: Display the fivefold of an input number if it's divisible by both 3 and 4. Otherwise, display the number times ten. <br />

🔷 **No. 05**: Convert an input number to the equivalent of a week day (ex. 1 -> Monday). Display an error message if the input is invalid. <br />

🔷 **No. 16**: A variable named selection takes values from input. Only the values in the set {2, 4, 5, 9} are allowed. Using an if statement, assign the value of that variable to a new one if the initial value is in set, otherwise make it zero. <br />

🔷 **No. 31**: Calculate the product of odd numbers from 1 to 15. <br />

🔷 **No. 32**: Generate ten capital consonants. <br />

🔷 **No. 33**: Display a table that shows the conversions between F and C, for values of 0 to 50 Fahrenheit. <br />

🔷 **No. 34**: Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. <br />

🔷 **No. 35**: Find the first 100 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. <br />

🔷 **No. 36**: Calculate the grade (A, B, C or fail) from the numbers between 0 and 100. Check for invalid inputs. <br />

🔷 **No. 37**: By using print() and a loop, create a NxN shape. <br />

🔷 **No. 38**: Create a table of approximate values of pi until it reaches 3.14. How many values pass until it reaches the value of 3.141? Use the Gregory-Leibniz series to solve this. <br />

🔷 **No. 39**: By using the MacLaurin equation, calculate the sine of an inputted x angle. <br />

### 👨‍🔬 Lab Exercise ###
🛠️ *No. 41*: Display a filled rhombus shape with asterisks in the console. The program will accept an integer as an input and display the shape with that many lines.<br />

🛠️ *No. 42*: Create a "Guess the Number" game. Ensure that it will: <br />
1. Display some guidelines at the start.
2. Count the player tries.
3. Inform the player about the comparison between the secret number and the guess.
4. Display a game over message if the player loses.
5. Allow the player to choose whether they want to replay or colse the program.
