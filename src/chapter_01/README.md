### 🗒️ Theory Questions ###
Here are two selected theory questions with quick answers. At this starting point, I found them rather interesting.
<br />
<details>
  <summary>
    ❓: No. 14: Which method does Java need to contain in order for it to be executed? <br />

   ❓: No. 16: Explain what is bytecode. <br /> 
  </summary>
  📇: Bytecode is an intermediate code generated after compiling a Java source file. It is executed by the JVM making Java platform-independent.

```

🔷 **No. 19**: Create a Java program that prints the following pattern: <br />
```
    *
